# Compare with Kompare service menu

This service menu makes it easier to compare text files using the default file comparison application
Kompare. While using the button in the Dolphin's toolbar, you can select two files from the
same tab, this service extends the range of reachable files to the clipboard area managed by
Klipper and to a cache file stored in the home directory.
