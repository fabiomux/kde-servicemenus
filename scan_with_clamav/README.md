# Scan with ClamAV service menu

This service menu accomplishes its primary function, the virus scanning through ClamAV
antivirus on selected files and folders, integrating the functionalities of another couple
of plugins, "Open Konsole Here" and "Open Yakuake Here".
Using the same code base, it opens the scanning procedure in one of these terminals,
within the current or a new session (Konsole and Yakuake), or reusing one of the opened
instances (Konsole).

## Features

These are the *Scan with ClamAV* service menu features:

- Fully translated into 4 languages besides English
  (French, German, Italian, Spanish);
- Works from within the Dolphin, Konqueror, Krusader, and KFind results context menu;
- Support for KDE Plasma 6;
- Scans the selected file or folder within the current or a new session (Konsole or Yakuake);
- Scans the selected file or folder within the first or last terminal instance (Konsole);

## Requirements

- KDE 4 or superior;
- KDialog;
- ClamAV

## Install

To keep the latest stable version installed, updated, and easily removed from the same interface,
it is recommended to install this service menu through *Dolphin*:

- From Settings > Context Menu > Download new services;
- Search for *Scan with ClamAV*;
- Click on the *Install* button.

Also, the *Discover* application can install it, but doesn't allow to select a localized version:

- Under Application Addons > Servicemenu;
- Search for: *Scan with ClamAV*;
- Click on the *Install* button.

For debugging purpose follow one of the other methods mentioned on the [project page][installation].
