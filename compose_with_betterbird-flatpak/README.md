# Compose with Betterbird - Flatpak edition service menu

This service menu is the exact clone of the "Compose with Betterbird" service menu,
but specifically thought for those using the Flatpak system.
It composes a new email using the selected files as attachments and Betterbird as
an email client.
It also allows to cache files from different folders and composing all of them later.

These are the *Compose with Betterbird - Flatpak edition* service menu features:

- Fully translated into 4 languages besides English
  (French, German, Italian, Spanish);
- Works from within the Dolphin, Konqueror, Krusader, and KFind results context menu;
- Support for KDE Plasma 6;
- Compose a new email attaching all the selected files in the folder;
- Store the selected files in a cache file;
- Compose a new email attaching all the cached files;
- Compose a new email attaching the selected file with the cached file;
- Open the cache file in the default editor (use the KSM_CWT_EDITOR variable to configure a custom one);
- Remove invalid files from the cache;
- Clean up the cache file.

## Requirements

it is recommended to install this service menu through *Dolphin*:

Also, the *Discover* application can install it, but doesn't allow to select a localized version:
