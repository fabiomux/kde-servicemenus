# Compose with Thunderbird service menu

This service menu is the exact clone of the "Compose with Thunderbird" service menu,
but specifically thought for those using the Flatpak system.
It composes a new email using the selected files as attachments and Thunderbird as
an email client.
It also allows caching files from different folders and composing them later.
For those using Flatpak, an identical addon dedicated to that system is available.

## Features

These are the *Compose with Thunderbird* service menu features:

- Fully translated into 4 languages besides English
  (French, German, Italian, Spanish);
- Works from within the Dolphin, Konqueror, Krusader, and KFind results context menu;
- Support for KDE Plasma 6;
- Compose a new email attaching all the selected files in the folder;
- Store the selected files in a cache file;
- Compose a new email attaching all the cached files;
- Compose a new email attaching the selected file with the cached file;
- Open the cache file in the default editor (use the KSM_CWT_EDITOR variable to configure a custom one);
- Remove invalid files from the cache;
- Clean up the cache file.

## Requirements

- KDE 4 or superior;
- KDialog;
- Flatpak;
- Thunderbird for Flatpak.

## Install

To keep the latest stable version installed, updated, and easily removed from the same interface,
it is recommended to install this service menu through *Dolphin*:

- From Settings > Context Menu > Download new services;
- Search for *Compose with Thunderbird*;
- Click on the *Install* button.

Also, the *Discover* application can install it, but doesn't allow to select a localized version:

- Under Application Addons > Servicemenu;
- Search for: *Compose with Thunderbird*;
- Click on the *Install* button.

For debugging purpose follow one of the other methods mentioned on the [project page][installation].
