# Open Konsole Here service menu

This service menu is thought to open the path we are browsing in our file manager within
the Konsole terminal. Among the opened windows can be selected the first, the last, or any
of them, through a Kdialog selection dialog.  Besides that, it also allows us to decide
if the session, visualized as a tab, has to be the current or a new one.

## Features

These are the *Open Konsole Here* service menu features:
- Fully translated into 5 languages besides English
  (Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish);
- Works from within the Dolphin, Konqueror, Krusader, and KFind results context menu;
- Support for KDE Plasma 6;
- Opens the path in the first or last opened window, or in a new one
- Can also select one of the opened windows, not necessarily the first or the last
- Opens the path in the first or last session or tab, in one of the aforementioned windows

## Requirements

- KDE 4 or superior;
- KDialog;
- konsole.

## Install

To keep the latest stable version installed, updated, and easily removed from the same interface,
it is recommended to install this service menu through *Dolphin*:
- From Settings > Context Menu > Download new services;
- Search for "open_konsole_here";
- Click on the *Install* button and select the localized archive of your choice.

Also, the *Discover* application can install it, but doesn't allow to select a localized version:
- Under Application Addons > Servicemenu;
- Search for: "open_konsole_here";
- Click on the *Install* button.

For debugging purpose follow one of the other methods mentioned on the [project page][installation].
