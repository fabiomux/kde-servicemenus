# Open Konsole Here service menu

This service menu is thought to open the path we are browsing in our file manager within
the Konsole terminal. Among the opened windows can be selected the first, the last or any
of them, through a Kdialog selection dialog.  Besides that, it also allows us to decide
if the session, visualized as a tab, has to be the current or a new one.
