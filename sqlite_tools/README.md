## Install

The recommended method to install this service menu is through *Dolphin*:
- From Settings > Context Menu > Download new services;
- Search for "sqlite_tools";
- Click on the *Install* button and select the localized archive of your choice.

That way the latest stable version is installed, updated, and easily removed from the same interface.

Also, the *Discover* application can install it, but doesn't allow to select a localized version:
- Under Application Addons > Servicemenu;
- Search for: "sqlite_tools";
- Click on the *Install* button.

For debugging purpose follow one of the other methods mentioned on the [project page][installation].
