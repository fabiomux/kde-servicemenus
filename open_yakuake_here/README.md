# Open Yakuake Here service menu

This service menu is thought to open the path that we are currently browsing in our file manager
within the Yakuake terminal. Besides that, it also allows to decide if the session, visualized as
a tab, has to be the current or a new one. Last but not least, we can optionally decide to split
the session in half, vertically or horizontally, and where change the path, either left or
right, or either top or bottom.
