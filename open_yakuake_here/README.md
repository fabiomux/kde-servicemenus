# Open Yakuake Here service menu

This service menu is thought to open the path from the file manager within
the Yakuake terminal. Besides that, it also allows us to decide if the session, visualized
as a tab, has to be the current one or a new one. Last but not least, we can optionally split
the session in half, vertically or horizontally, and open the selected path in the left or right
panel, top or bottom.

## Features

These are the *Open Yakuake Here* service menu features:
- Fully translated into 7 languages besides English
  (Catalan, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish);
- Works from within the Dolphin, Konqueror, Krusader, and KFind-results context menu;
- Support for KDE Plasma 6;
- Opens the path in the current or new session
- Splits the session horizontally and opens the terminal either in the top or bottom panel
- Splits the session vertically and opens the terminal either in the left or right panel
- When opening a new session, it also renames the tab with the folder name
- Renames the active tab with the current full path, dirname, or directory path

## Requirements

- KDE 4 or superior;
- KDialog;
- Yakuake

## Install

To keep the latest stable version installed, updated, and easily removed from the same interface,
it is recommended to install this service menu through *Dolphin*:
- From Settings > Context Menu > Download new services;
- Search for "open_yakuake_here";
- Click on the *Install* button.

Also, the *Discover* application can install it, but doesn't allow to select a localized version:
- Under Application Addons > Servicemenu;
- Search for: "open_yakuake_here";
- Click on the *Install* button.

For debugging purpose follow one of the other methods mentioned on the [project page][installation].
