# Download with youtube-dl here service menu

The service menu allows downloading media files from within one of the supported
websites, or from a direct URL, in the current folder using the *youtube-dl* command line
tool. Having this application no more updates, probably want to try the successor,
*yt-dlp* and the related service menu in my collection.

  (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish);

## Requirements

## Install

To keep the latest stable version installed, updated, and easily removed from the same interface,
it is recommended to install this service menu through *Dolphin*:
- From Settings > Context Menu > Download new services;
- Search for "download_with_youtube-dl_here";
- Click on the *Install* button and select the localized archive of your choice.

Also, the *Discover* application can install it, but doesn't allow to select a localized version:
- Under Application Addons > Servicemenu;
- Search for: "download_with_youtube-dl_here";
- Click on the *Install* button.

For debugging purpose follow one of the other methods mentioned on the [project page][installation].
